CC0 1.0 Universal

STATEMENT OF PURPOSE

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) of an original work of authorship and/or a
database (each, a "Work").

Certain creators desire to relinquish those rights to the fullest extent
allowed by law so that others may freely build upon, enhance and reuse the
Work for any purposes without restriction under copyright or database
law.

These creators may desire to offer a Work as free of charge, in the
public domain, and freely accessible to all for any purpose, without any
requirement of payment, attribution or notification or any other legal
formalities or restrictions.

Therefore, those creators may apply CC0 to their Work and publicly
announce that they have dedicated the Work to the public domain to the
fullest extent allowed by law.
